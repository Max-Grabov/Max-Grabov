## Hi there, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student at the University of Central Florida studying Mathematics and Computer Science and part of the Astrodynamics, Space & Robotics Laboratory.

With the work I do currently, a lot of my coding activities is through private gitlab instances, or private github repositories. If my profile seems a bit empty that's why.
Also My current projects on here are a bit... trash to say the least. Hopefully I'll find the motivation to rewrite my old code to have much better standards
